For this project, I worked with databases provided by the CDMX government. With information from the taxpayers and their vehicles, it was possible to train a classification model to estimate who will pay for their car ownership. 
I use data balancing techniques, feature engineering and expert knowledge of people in the tax area. 
The final model is a Gradient Boosting, but a Catboost was also tried.
